		<div class="bg-warning">JJBA is a very interesting show, its very difficult to understand what the plot is in this show, for now I will be talking about the most popular season of this show and thats Golden Wind. Golden Wind is the 5th season of Jojo and its one of my favorite parts, its about the main character putting a stop on drug addicts and in JoJo there is this some sort of power and its called a stand, a stand is the manifestation of ones soul and whoever is worthy will be able to get a stand. The main character Giorno finds a gang that he will be using as cover in order to get close to the boss and kill him so that he can put a stop to his plans. JoJo is a very interesting show and I recommend it to whoever wants to get into anime. The important characters on screen are Giorno Giovanna, Bruno Buccarati, Leone Abbacchio, Pannacotta Fugo, Narancia Ghirga, and Trish Una and the main villain on this show is named Diavolo.</div>
